    /** @class Semaphore (WaiterPreferenceSemaphore)
    * @brief An implementation of counting Semaphores that
    * enforces enough fairness for applications that
    * need to avoid indefinite overtaking without
    * necessarily requiring FIFO ordered access.
    *
    * Empirically, very little is paid for this property
    * unless there is a lot of contention among threads
    * or very unfair OS scheduling.
    * The acquire method waits even if there are permits
    * available but have not yet been claimed by threads that have
    * been notified but not yet resumed. This makes the semaphore
    * almost as fair as the underlying primitives allow.
    * So, if synch lock entry and notify are both fair
    * so is the semaphore -- almost:  Rewaits stemming
    * from timeouts in attempt, along with potentials for
    * interrupted threads to be notified can compromise fairness,
    * possibly allowing later-arriving threads to pass before
    * later arriving ones. However, in no case can a newly
    * entering thread obtain a permit if there are still others waiting.
    * Also, signalling order need not coincide with
    * resumption order. Later-arriving threads might get permits
    * and continue before other resumable threads are actually resumed.
    * However, all of these potential fairness breaches are
    * very rare in practice....
